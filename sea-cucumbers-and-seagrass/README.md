Code and data for the manuscrpt "Sea cucumbers can enhance the effect of fish-derived nutrients on seagrass productivity" by Hannah V. Watkins, Rachel B. Munger, and Isabelle M. Côté. If the entire sub-repo is downloaded together, you will be able to open the `Code.Rproj` file in the Code folder and run all analyses on a local computer without needing to set a working directory or changing filepaths in the code. Models are run with the `brms` package, which is based on Stan and requires a C++ compiler to run. The program `RTools` has a compiler (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and instructions on how to get the compiler running are here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started. The Data folder contains all raw data for the project and the cleaned datasets generated by the `data_cleaning.R` file, as well as all the saved model outputs from the `analyses.R` file. The Code folder contains the scripts used to clean, analyze, and create figures from the data, as well as a script with a custom plotting theme. All code is heavily annotated but please feel free to contact me at hannahvwatkins@gmail.com if you have any questions.
